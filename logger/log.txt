 - started the project for fixing file extension issues.
 - fixing file extension handling using `std::filesystem`.
 - Created a function to extract extension of a file 
 - faced issue with finding the correct file extension for multiple files and handling folders.
 - Suggestion provided: Modify the logic to use `std::filesystem::path` for file extensions and creating directories.
 - modified code: Corrected file extension parsing and folder creation logic.
 - Error encountered: "undefined reference" when calling `save(files)` in `main.cpp`.
 - Suggested solution: Ensure the correct header file inclusion and that the function signature matches.
 - attempted compiling with the following command: `g++ -std=c++17 -o program home/main.cpp src/core.cpp`.
 - Error encountered name is undefined 
 - Error resolved after rechecking the code, specifically ensuring correct definition and scope of `save`.
 - successfully compiled the program and executed the file handling logic.
 - Added exception handling to the code
 - Final review of code: Folder creation and file extension logic successfully fixed using `std::filesystem`.
 - Error encountered during final tests : File not found at given loction un able to move
 - Error resolved after give absolute path to the string 
 - Program successfully organized files based on their extensions, creating respective folders and moving them accordingly.
