# gtk_multimeia_organiser

The aim of this project is to organise multimedia files present in a folder by creating categorised subfolders or by moving to the categorised folders where the user wishes them to be.

for instance, we have some files in download folder that are images, videos, pdf , documents etc what our program will do is simply going to create some folders like images videos documents and there it will move all the files.

## Features

- [ ] Program as a daemon or a service.

  - [ ] You would need to create Two Mode program i.e. let say you want to run the app without opening the gui(ofc after configuring it once you don't want to see the config window again and again) To cope with this You would want to read config generated by the gui

---

- [ ] Gui frontend written in cross platform technology could be any framework with cpp binding

  - [ ] implementing User preferred folders ( do give an option to let the user choose using the respective platform filepicker api)
  - [ ] Implementing Stop(Globally) and Start(Globally) button for the service
  - [ ] config file Generation

---

- [ ] Code üèÜ

  - [ ] First Read from the config filej
  - [ ] make a CreateFolder() function that makes folder on the basis of the input provided by the user

  - [ ] then a MoveFile() before executing make sure you don't overwrite the already present file and rename the file with filename1.extension. MoveFile() Should read file in the folder not in sub folders/\*. as soon as it read it moves the file if a file is not presetn there already.
